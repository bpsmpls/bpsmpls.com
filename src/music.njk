			<p>Since 2005, I've recorded 20 major releases across 3 musical projects. For each release, I served as audio engineer, producer, mixer, musician, and graphic designer.</p>

			<p>This work has slowed in recent years, but I'm still writing music with my current band as well as collaborating as a session musician or engineer when called to.</p>
